# Athenian Diplomatic Web

## Repository
This repository is made to host the interactive map for the conference paper ["The Diplomatic Networks of Ancient Athens: The Evidence
from the Decrees"](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.12606021) presented at the Historical Network Research Conference 2024

## Data
The data is derived from the Inscriptiones Graecae corpus of decrees (partially available online at (http://telota.bbaw.de/ig/ or https://www.atticinscriptions.com/).   
Locations mentioned in the context of diplomatic decrees were charted using the coordinates from https://pleiades.stoa.org/.

## Methodology
The map was charted using the python modules folium and networkx, while the timeline was created using plotly. The Script used for the generation and the raw data is also deposited here.
